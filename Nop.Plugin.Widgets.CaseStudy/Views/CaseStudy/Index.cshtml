                    This doesn’t have to be a perfectly crafted case studies, Impacto can tidy it up for you. In your own words, and in as much detail as you are able to, drop them down below.

                    You may wish to say something like:
                    One of our volunteers worked closely with a young person who had recently arrived in the UK and was struggling to settle into school. Through weekly mentoring sessions, they built trust and confidence, and the young person is now attending school regularly and has joined a local football club. You can also add in a quote here from the young person or the volunteer.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Or:
                    In partnership with a local food bank, we supported 25 families over the winter months with weekly food parcels, advice sessions and warm clothing. One parent told us the support meant they could focus on finding work without worrying about their children going hungry.”
                    These don’t need to be polished - just honest and detailed. Impacto will take care of tidying it up and incorporating it into your report.
